It is a well known fact that some people do not have their social
completely enabled. One example is the lack of talent for calculating
and intervals of time. This causes some people to always choose the
way to go from one place to another, with the consequence that they
late to whatever appointments they have, including weddings and
C¨¦sar has this kind of problem. When he has to go from one point to
he realizes that he has to visit many people, and thus always chooses
longest path. One of C¨¦sar's friends, Felipe, has understood the
of the problem. Felipe thinks that with the help of a computer he
be able to calculate the time that C¨¦sar is going to need to arrive
his destination. That way he could spend his time in something more
Your goal is to help Felipe developing a program that computes the
of the longest path that can be constructed in a given graph from a
starting point (C¨¦sar's residence). You can assume that there is at
one path from this starting point to any destination. Also, the graph
no cycles (there is no path from any node to itself), so C¨¦sar will
his destination in a finite time. In the same line of reasoning, nodes
The input consists of a number of cases. The first line on each case
a positive number n ( ) that specifies the number of points that
After this, a second number s is provided, indicating the starting
in C¨¦sar's journey ( ). Then, you are given a list of pairs of places
and q, one pair per line, with the places on each line separated by
As mentioned before, you can assume that the graphs provided will not
For each test case you have to find the length of the longest path
begins at the starting place. You also have to print the number of the
place of such longest path. If there are several paths of maximum
