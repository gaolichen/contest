There are several cards, each has a value, represented by a positive integer. 
We consider these cards are "good" cards, only if: 
1) they can dived into several groupes exactly, and each group consist of 3 
   cards. 
2) the card-value of each group are consecutive or are the same. for example, 
   4, 5, 6 are consecutive; 3, 3, 3 of the same; but 3, 4, 4 is not satisfy 
   the condition. 
If we add a card to these cards, and them become "good" cards, than we consider 
these cards are "not bad" cards . 

Input
There is several cases. Every case, consist of two lines. The first line is a 
positive integer n, n<=1000, the follow line consist of n positive integer 
numbers, a[1], a[2]... a[n], a[i] represent the number of card whose value is i.  

Output
If these cards is "good cards", output a "good", else if they are "not bad" cards 
output a "not bad", and the next line, output all the cards, that can be added to 
these cards so that make these cards become "good" cards, the value of the output 
cards should in ascending order.
