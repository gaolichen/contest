Problem Description

ID ,short for identity ,is the name of the people in the BBS. Domain name, is 
short for name of a country in the internet. One day,some students in the ZJU
freecity BBS found that , there a great relation between a ID and a domain 
name.We called a ID contain a domain name,if
(1) the two letter of the domain name both can be found in the ID

(2) 1 contain the same domain name as 2,and 1 is shorter than 2 or
(3) 1 contain the same domain name as 2,and they are the same length,and 1 
    is in the previous of 2 in alphabetical order

Give n domain names ,you are asked to judge whether there are some IDs,whose
length are not more than twelve,contain all the n domain names.
